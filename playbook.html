    <h2>Playbook</h2>
    <h3>Rules</h3>
    <p>1. Assemble the game board by arranging the modular tiles according to the setup guide. Each configuration changes the dynamics of the game.</p>
    <p>2. Distribute initial resources to each player, including weapons and health markers. Players can trade resources during the game.</p>
    
    <h3>Gameplay Mechanics</h3>
    <p>Each turn consists of a movement phase and an action phase. Players must navigate the board, engage in combat, and manage resources wisely to survive.</p>
    
    <h3>Combat System</h3>
    <p>Combat is resolved through dice rolls and character abilities:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Roll a die to determine the outcome of your attack. Higher rolls indicate successful hits.</li>
        <li>Use character abilities to enhance your chances of survival. Each character has unique skills that can be leveraged strategically.</li>
        <li>Defeated zombies may drop resources or trigger events. Players must decide whether to risk exploring these areas.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Winning and Losing</h3>
    <p>To win, players must survive through all levels, defeat the final boss, and complete any required objectives. If all players die or fail to complete objectives within a set number of turns, the game is lost.</p>
    
    <h3>Tips for Success</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Communicate with your team to share resources and strategies. Teamwork is essential for survival.</li>
        <li>Explore cautiously; some areas may hold valuable supplies but also dangerous threats. Always have an escape plan.</li>
        <li>Prioritize objectives to increase your chances of survival. Completing missions can yield valuable rewards.</li>
        <li>Use the environment to your advantage. Set traps and barricades to slow down zombie hordes.</li>
    </ul>
