    <h2>Lore</h2>
    <p>In a world devastated by a zombie outbreak, humanity struggles to survive. The infection spread rapidly, turning ordinary people into mindless, flesh-eating monsters. Cities fell, governments collapsed, and society as we knew it disintegrated.</p>
    
    <h3>The Outbreak</h3>
    <p>The outbreak began in a small town but quickly spread across the globe. Panic ensued as people fought for survival, leading to chaos and destruction. Survivors banded together to create makeshift communities, but trust became a rare commodity.</p>
    
    <h3>Survivor Factions</h3>
    <p>As the world changed, different factions emerged, each with its own beliefs and survival strategies:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>The Guardians:</strong> A group focused on protecting the innocent and rebuilding society. They believe in cooperation and share resources among survivors.</li>
        <li><strong>The Raiders:</strong> Ruthless scavengers who take what they need by force. They live by the motto "survival of the fittest," often leading to violent confrontations.</li>
        <li><strong>The Scavengers:</strong> Resourceful individuals who thrive on finding supplies and information. They are known for their cunning and ingenuity.</li>
        <li><strong>The Cult of the Undead:</strong> A mysterious group that worships the zombies, believing they are the next step in evolution. They seek to spread the infection willingly.</li>
    </ul>

        <li><strong>Special Infected:</strong> Unique zombies with special abilities, such as spitting acid or creating distractions. These are rare but can change the tide of battle.</li>
    </ul>
